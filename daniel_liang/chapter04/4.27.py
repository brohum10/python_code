        As a way to determine if a point is inside the triangle is to detect 
        if the line connecting the point with the any angle point (the upper 
        angle point (0, 100) for example) is intersecting with the facing side 
        of the triangle (horizontal line in this example) at a point between the 
        other tow angle points ((0, 0) and (200, 0) in this example) then the 
        point is inside the triangle, otherwise it is outside the triangle.
        so here x1 = 0, y1 = 100, x2 = user input, y2 = user input, x3 = 0, 
        y3 = 0, x4 = 200 and y4 = 0. We need to get intersecting point coordinates
        x and y by solving linear equation:
        (y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
        (y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3

x3 = 0
y3 = 0
x4 = 200
y4 = 0

# Prompt the user for entering a point:
x2, y2 = eval(input("Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates: "))

# Calculate a, b, c, d, e, f
a = y1 - y2
b = x1 - x2
c = y3 - y4
d = x3 - x4
e = (y1 - y2) * x1 - (x1 - x2) * y1
f = (y3 - y4) * x3 - (x3 - x4) * y3

# If parallel lines then the point is outside the triangle
if (a * d - b * c) == 0:
    print("The point is not in the triangle")
    sys.exit(0)

# If not parallel line then compute x and y
x = (e * d - b * f) / (a * d - b * c)
y = (a * f - e * c) / (a * d - b * c)

# If intersecting point is between other tow angle points, it 's OK
if x >= 0 and x <= 200:
    print("The point is in the triangle")
